/*Boston house pricing data*/

--Question 1: Run the following code and check the result

SELECT * FROM dbo.boston_house;

--Question 2: Now, can you only select the data for regions close to Charles River?

--Question 4: If the crime rate is lower than or equal to 1 per thousand, we define this region's safety as 'high', between 1 and 5 would be 'medium',
--higher than 5 would be 'low'. Can you create a variable safety_ind to represent this info?

--Question 6: Now run left/inner join on the order data and fulfillment data. Check the result and elaborate the difference between those 
--joins

/*Boston house pricing data*/

--Problem 1: Can you only select the data for median price higher than 25?

else 'cheap' end as price_ind,

from dbo.boston_house;

--Problem 3: If the average number of rooms per dwelling is higher than 6 and the proportion of old owner-occupied units is lower than 80%), then we say that the region's fancy_house indicator is 'Y' otherwise it would be 'N'. Create a new variable fancy_house to capture that.
select id, rm, age,

--Problem 4: If the pupil-teacher ratio is lower than 20 then we say the edu_ind ='good' else it would be 'ok'. Create a new variable in edu_ind to capture that.

-- if the fancy house is positive but the education indicator is negative, then we say that the quality_ind is 'Nice to live', 
-- if the education indicator is positive but the fancy house is negative, then we say that the quality_ind is 'Good education', 
-- if either of them is positive, then the quality_ind is 'No good'. Create a new variable quality_ind for that.

/*Walmart sales and features data*/

--Problem 7: With the feature and sales data joined, define a variable temp_ind with the following logic: if temperature is higher than 86 then 'Hot', between 50 and 86 would be 'Nice', and lower than 50 would be 'Cold'.

--Problem 8: Find the average weekly sales per store under different temp_ind. Note: for this question, you need to aggregate the total sales for each store on a given week first.
